#In range , when two numbers is given, the lowest number 
#is subtracted from the highest number to give out the last 
#number where the list or the loop ends example,
#range of 1-10 {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} 
#2: In ascending order , its written this way , 
#for i in range(1,10) but, in descending order,
#its written as for i in range(9,0,-1)
